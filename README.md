htmlks4wp
=========

The name of the wordpress theme _htmlks4wp_ means HTML-KiskStart for WordPress. It uses a CSS framework [HTMK-KiskStart](http://www.99lime.com/elements/) so that we can show the contents simply and clearly. Since the theme has been written and optimized for my own use, it may not be extended for general uses.

The sample website using this theme is following.
