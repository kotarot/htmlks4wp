What is htmlks4wp
-----------------------------------------------------------

HTML-KiskStart for WordPress (htmlks4wp) is a simple responsive wordpress theme based on [HTMK-KickStart](http://www.99lime.com/).
The name of the wordpress theme _htmlks4wp_ means HTML-KiskStart for WordPress. It is based on a CSS framework [HTMK-KickStart](http://www.99lime.com/) so that we can show the contents simply and clearly. Since the theme has been written and optimized for my own use, it may not be extended for general uses.
